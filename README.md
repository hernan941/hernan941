## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm HernÃ¡n

I'm currently working with **Python**, building APIs using **FastAPI** â€” clean, modular, and focused on the backend side of things.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into **Go (Golang)** to expand my backend toolkit. Iâ€™m drawn to its simplicity and performance.

I care about writing code thatâ€™s maintainable, efficient, and does what itâ€™s supposed to do without overcomplicating things.


### ðŸ§° Tech I use often

- **Python** (FastAPI, SQLModel, Celery)
- **Go**
- **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **Docker**
- **AWS** (ECS, EC2, RDS, S3)
- **JS/TypeScript + React** for UI work

This GitHub is a mix of experiments, side projects, and things I'm learning along the way.
